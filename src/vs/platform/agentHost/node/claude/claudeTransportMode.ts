/**
 * Whether the SDK's own account report describes a Claude setup that can serve
 * requests on the user's own credentials — the single rule behind both the
 * advertised requirement and the native model catalog. Only the SDK can answer
 * honestly: a `claude login` credential lives in the macOS keychain, invisible
 * to `process.env` and `~/.claude/settings.json` alike.
 *
 * The two branches must NOT be collapsed. `apiProvider` reports `'firstParty'`
 * even for an empty home directory, so it is a presence signal for nobody — it
 * is consulted only to spot a *third-party* backend (Bedrock, Vertex, a
 * gateway), whose credential fields the SDK documents as absent because auth is
 * external. Requiring a credential field there would lock every one of them out.
 *
 * Says *configured*, not *working*: verifying would cost a billable request per
 * check, and the failure being fixed here is genuinely set-up users locked out.
